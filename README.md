# hello-world

Hi,

Surinder here, I like programming and love to spend time on learning new things everyday.
C#, Java, SQL, jQuery, JavaScript, php, J2EE, HTML5 and CSS3 are the ones that I am using for academic assignments and projects.
Apart from programming, I also have interest in Networking as i am at the begging stage of learning. So, exploring all my interests at this point.
# Curently teaching myself Bootstrap 4 and preparing for CCNA. So far going good :-)
